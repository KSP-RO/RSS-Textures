Real Solar System Texture pack (DDS Edition) for KSP 1.3.1+ (RSS-Kopernicus)

GitHub: https://github.com/KSP-RO/RSS-Textures

This is a texture pack for Real Solar System, which will convert the Kerbol System into the Solar System, rescaling, moving, and changing KSP's planets, moons, etc. to match our own.

Installation:
Unzip the RSS-Textures folder in the GameData folder in the archive to your KSP GameData folder, so you'll have KSP/GameData/RSS-Textures (and inside that lots of dds files). You can then manually replace some of the textures with different-resolution textures from the repository if you so choose.


Supreme thanks to dimonnomid and SpacedInvader and grayduster and Dr. Walther and KellanHiggins and KillAshley for incredible art for RSS. RSS would not look or perform the way it does (or have gotten released!) without their amazing contributions.

v13.0 for RSS 13.0
* update all repositories to use Pap's Scaled RSS Textures which are made to take advantage new kopernicus versions
* allows unloaded textures to use "on demand" loading of non-Home bodies. Memory demand should be reduced significantly.
* See https://github.com/pap1723/ScaledRSS-Textures for previous work including :>
   * Updated Moon Biomes map for use with the modified biomes config
   * New, higher quality Mars Map
   * Fixed Oberon Biomes to match on edges
   * Updated the Earth Biome Map to remove the Chapparal biome
* Major changes to biomes on earth and moon, simplification and clean up of all other bodies.
* Bodies have updated textures with improved mipmaps and normals.


v10.4 for RSS 10.6
* Added new-Pluto and Charon biomes

v10.3 for RSS 10.6
* Higher fidelity normal, color maps for many bodies (hand-tweaked as necessary).
* Downsized heightmaps for bodies where existing maps caused "step" / pixelation issues.
