This is a texture pack for Real Solar System, which will convert the Kerbol System into the Solar System, rescaling, moving, and changing KSP's planets, moons, etc. to match our own.

Installation:
Unzip the RSS-Textures folder in the GameData folder in the archive to your KSP GameData folder, so you'll have KSP/GameData/RSS-Textures (and inside that lots of dds files). You can then manually replace some of the textures with different-resolution textures from the repository if you so choose.


Supreme thanks to dimonnomid and SpacedInvader and grayduster for incredible art for RSS. RSS would not look or perform the way it does (or have gotten released!) without their amazing contributions.
